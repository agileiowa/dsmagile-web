title: As a Des Moines Agile conference goer, I want to learn some of the basics so that I can apply them properly in my organization.
abstract: |
     Whether you're just getting started or would like a refresher because things have gotten stale, this session will take it from the top. We will discuss agile as a mindset, tactics to try, and most importantly, the "why?" behind each one. This session will cover the importance of motivation, the framework of a sprint, and why people keep talking about lean manufacturing in Japan. Questions are welcome throughout and we may just see where the conversation takes us.
