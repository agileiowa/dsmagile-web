title: (Technical) Demoes That Don't Suck
abstract: |
    One of the key parts of successful agile development is making sure that feedback loops are setup. An extremely common practice is to establish demos to make sure teams can show progress and can guide on where to go next.
    <br/><br/>
    Demos, when done poorly, do not help teams improve. They become expensive status updates. They become a means to show untested code disguised as production quality experiences. They become a means to guilt and shame teams stuck with a difficult problem.
    <br/><br/>
    Two years ago, I did a presentation called Demos That Don't Suck. I recommended against giving technical demos. Many people are in environments where that is not possible.
    <br/><br/>
    This talk will go over what I have learned over the years of giving demos. This talk id for those of you having to get feedback on features like non-functional improvements, technical products like APIs and SDKs, or migration projects where you need to successfully show you did nothing to the customer experience.

          Hey everyone. I have been a developer, tester, product person, and almost all the Scrum roles now at John Deere over the past 10 years. My focus has been on making sure all the distributed pieces and their teams can all function and work together so that the end customer has an experience worth using. Most recently, I have become the John Deere API Guy. This means that I now focusing on finding ways to get multiple companies to function and work together.
          <br/><br/>
          Outside of work, I continually focus on improvement. How can we maintain the house better? How can we write a better research paper? How can we make sure this Dungeons and Dragons adventure is more engaging to the players? How can we get this AI to finally beat a player at a specific board game? I believe there is no perfect and everything can be made better. I try to live that both at work and in my personal life.
