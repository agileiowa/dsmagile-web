          Hey everyone. I have been a developer, tester, product person, and almost all the Scrum roles now at John Deere over the past 10 years. My focus has been on making sure all the distributed pieces and their teams can all function and work together so that the end customer has an experience worth using. Most recently, I have become the John Deere API Guy. This means that I now focusing on finding ways to get multiple companies to function and work together.
          <br/><br/>
          Outside of work, I continually focus on improvement. How can we maintain the house better? How can we write a better research paper? How can we make sure this Dungeons and Dragons adventure is more engaging to the players? How can we get this AI to finally beat a player at a specific board game? I believe there is no perfect and everything can be made better. I try to live that both at work and in my personal life.
