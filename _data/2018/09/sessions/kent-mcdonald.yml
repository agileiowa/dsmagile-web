title: How to build shared understanding with example mapping
abstract: |
    One of the primary responsibilities of business analysts, product owners, and all other product people is to build and maintain a shared understanding of the outcome your team seeks to deliver. Conversations are an effective way to build that shared understanding.
    <br/><br/>
    You may find yourself wondering who should be included in those conversations, when do you have these conversations, what should you talk about, and how do you remember what you said?
    <br/><br/>
    Join Kent McDonald as he introduces example mapping, a technique that helps you structure your conversations and build a shared understanding.
    <br/><br/>
    You’ll learn how to determine the right people to include in your conversations, when the best time is to have those conversations, how to structure those conversations, and how to remember what you said.
