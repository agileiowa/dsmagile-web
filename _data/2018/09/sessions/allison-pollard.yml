abstract: |
    As agilists, how are we affected by our relationships with transforming organizations? Organizations treat an agile transformation as a singular event. A budgetary line item, a noun, a one-time metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly. The danger is that we expect people to transform in a particular way or on a schedule.
    <br /><br />
    We believe organizations benefit when we transform the way we assist organizations. In this interactive workshop, Allison and Barry will facilitate discussion on experiences with transformations and what might happen within an organization if we more actively transform ourselves.
    <br /><br />
    Join us as we explore who and what is transforming through agile transformations.
