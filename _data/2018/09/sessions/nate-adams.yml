title: Techniques to Explain Agile Mindset and Practices to your Grandmother, Your Five-Year-Old or Your Boss
link: 
abstract: |
    A couple decades ago, when I started my life as a software developer, my grandma often tried to understand what it was that I did for a living so she could dote on me to her friends (as good Grandmothers are wont to do). Unfortunately, there were some big gaps in our shared context that made it hard for her to truly grasp how I spent my time on an average day. As I've started to spend less time writing code, and more time coaching and training teams in Agile practices and methodologies, I've found that my inability to explain what I do for a living has grown from effecting elderly relatives to just people in general. Interestingly, even as I speak to people who should understand, it often feels that we're speaking different languages or about completely different topics. Even when we use the same words, we're often not actually talking about the same thing.
    <br/><br/>
    This talk is about building bridges over gaps in our shared understanding. There are a lot of misrepresentations of Agile out in the wild today, and a lot of them in some pretty visible places. Let's clear these away and start fresh. More importantly, let's start simple, and talk about Agile concepts in ways that your grandmother, your kindergartner or even your boss can understand.
    <br/><br/>
    We'll cover some really simple, fun and engaging ways to talk about what this Agile thing is (and what it isn't). We'll talk about some myths and misconceptions that are out there and how to address them when we encounter them. We'll discuss how to talk about Agile concepts (even some complex ones) in the language the leaders of our businesses speak and understand so we can ensure that we're reaching a shared understanding while convincing them that these concepts are vital to success in today's successful industries. Most importantly, we'll have some fun while doing it.
    <br/><br/>
    With a little practice, you'll have them begging you to implement more!
