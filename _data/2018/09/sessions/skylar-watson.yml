title: Outcome Metrics Lead To Valuable Practices
abstract: |
    Whereas output metrics (such as stories completed per week) measure aspects of a team’s localized productivity, outcome metrics (such as how much these features increase customer productivity) measure the difference the teams’ work makes in the world.
    Focus on output metrics can lead to increased waste and unnecessary stress, and distracts the organization from achieving more valuable outcomes. 
    In this talk, through stories and group exercises, you’ll see how you can better measure and improve your organization’s effectiveness.
