title: You're Not a Code Monkey, So Stop Acting Like One!
link: 
abstract: |
    A lot of people think the job of a software developer is merely to write code, specifically code that they were told to write by their boss.
    <br/><br/>
    A lot of people are wrong.
    <br/><br/>
    Organizations don't need programmers, and they don't need code. What they need are problem identifiers and problem solvers. They need opportunity recognizers and realizers. And whether they know it or not (and to be fair, many do not), they need their software developers to act as full partners in making decisions and deciding strategy.
    <br/><br/>
    If you are a software developer, you have the opportunity and the responsibility to leverage your expertise and skills to help your organization see what is actually possible and accomplish it, to see alternatives that are cheaper, faster, or just plain better, whether you work in an exciting startup environment or sit in a beige cube in a sea of beige cubes.
    <br/><br/>
    You are responsible for not only creating value through technology but also for maintaining that capability, and you don't get to pretend that "they won't let me" is a valid excuse.
    <br/><br/>
    Merely slinging code is not enough. You are not a code monkey following orders. You are a first-class citizen in the organization, more than capable of driving value as well as delivering it. Let's discuss how you (and your organization) can start acting like it.

      bio: | 
        Gianfranco Berardi (he | him | his) is a part-time indie game developer who loves to encourage curiosity, support creativity, and promote continuous learning. He likes to figure out how things work, whether it involves the dynamic systems of a computer game or the large interactions within an organization.
        <br/><br/>
        Leveraging the insight he gained from owning and operating his own game development business since 2006 and working professionally in software development within larger businesses owned by others, he loves to figure out how business and IT can be aligned rather than dysfunctional.
        <br/><br/>
        He is passionate about inclusion because he believes in the inherent worth and dignity of every person. Your best work comes when you are able to be comfortable being your authentic self.
        <br/><br/>
        On this blog, he writes about all aspects of running an indie game development business, including game design, development, publishing, and marketing.
