        Cleveland’s GiveCamp is the most magical, tiring, and worthwhile 48 hours anyone will
        experience professionally. For example, in 2015, 200 techies volunteered their talents and passion to
        help 19 non-profits with projects including data collection, websites, GPS-enabled mobile app, an
        educational online game, and database applications. How does so much work get done in such little
        amount of time? Agile in hyperdrive – standups every 4 hours, adhoc swarming with heavy hitter devs
        roaming the projects, and lots of free food and drinks to keep everyone fortified.
        <br/><br/>
        This case study reviews how so much work gets done in such a short amount of time. Each GiveCamp
        weekend consists of 48 hours to developer, complete, and hand-off the sites or apps to the nonprofit to
        be self-sufficient in using and maintaining it thereafter. The organizations are prepped to have a Product
        Owner on site the entire weekend sitting right there with the techies on the team, ready to make
        decisions on the spot and keep development moving forward. If something isn’t working – the team can
        immediately pivot. A lot of intriguing functionality came from asking “it would be great if our site
        could…”. A scrummaster attends standup every 4 hours, teamwork reigns as everyone maps out the
        stories to accomplish the goal, and pairing and collaboration amongst everyone is key. It helps that the
        location, hyped up wifi, office supplies RedBull, coffee, ice cream, and all meals and beverages are
        donated by local companies to keep the teams going.
