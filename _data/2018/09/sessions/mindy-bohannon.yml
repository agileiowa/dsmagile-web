title: "Case Study: Agile & Scrum during GiveCamp"
link: 
abstract: |
    GiveCamp is the most magical, tiring, and worthwhile 48 hours of my year. In 2015, 200 techies volunteered their talents and passion to help 19 non-profits with projects including data collection, websites, GPS-enabled mobile app, an educational online game, and database applications. How does so much work get done in such little amount of time? Agile at the speed of light– standups every 4 hours, adhoc swarming with heavy hitter devs roaming the projects, and lots of donated food and drinks to keep everyone fortified. This case study reviews how so much work gets done in such a short amount of time using agile principles and scrum ceremonies.

        After Oracle development and other assorted IT roles, Mindy is at last a Business Solutions Analyst. Her goal is to solve business problems, ensure communication amongst stakeholders and team members, develop solutions that drive the business forward and to relate to others with humanity during the process. And if it has a good soundtrack to do the work by, then all the better. She often says, "Judge me by my questions, not my answers." –Voltaire
