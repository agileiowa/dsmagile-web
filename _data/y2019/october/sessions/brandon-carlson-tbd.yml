abstract: | 
    Agile allows us to adapt to change. Good requirements allow us to satisfy our customers. User experience helps us build software that people love. Test-Driven Development leads to good design. I mean, if we do these things, then it's impossible to fail right? Wait, what? Do you still have failing projects too? I thought it was just me? Maybe it's time we forget about the buzzword bingo and start talking about what really makes organizations successful: Relationships. RelationSHIP: Relation comes before SHIP, join Brandon to learn how.
