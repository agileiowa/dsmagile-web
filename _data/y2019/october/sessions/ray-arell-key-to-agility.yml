link: 
abstract: | 
    Is Scrum, TDD, planning poker, Kanban, Nexus, or any of the countless methods and frameworks the key to successful organizational adoption of Agile?  Or is it the enablement provided by company leadership and coaches that makes the most significant impact?    Perhaps it is something else--maybe it all has to do with novelty.    In this talk, Ray Arell will share with you what he has learned from helping to launch more than three thousand Agile teams across hundreds of organizations.   This will include covering the successes and mistakes when trying to adopt Agile within Fortune 100 companies and how novelty plays a crucial role in creating high engagement.
