title: Are Agile Scaling Models the New Snake Oil?
link: 
abstract: | 
    Scaling models offering to systematize and spread agile have become the de facto approach to agile adoption; creating a multimillion dollar industry. In fact, 30% of organizations have reported using SAFe and 5% using Spotify, to introduce agile at scale in their organizations.
    <br/><br/>
    While these models can be helpful in establishing baseline understanding across cohorts; they are rife with misrepresentation and confusion. 
    Using my direct experience as a former agile transformation consultant and current (and happy) Spotify engineering executive, let's dissect the more popular models; dispel their myths; and refocus on what it really takes to succeed at scale.
