title: Agile Advocates and Practitioners from the C-Suite and Beyond
link: 
abstract: | 
    In this session we will focus on two fundamental challenges faced by many product managers and executives. The first one is how to create and maintain the advocacy you need for agile programs to survive and thrive within your organization, and here we will focus on the c-suite and key stakeholders, and how to shift conversations and decision making to value, outcomes, and customer focus. The second challenge is how to identify the right opportunities to drive agile methods, principles and practices into the rest of your organization. Here we look at enterprise focus, decision velocity, communication, collaboration and collective intelligence as we empower self-managing teams to solve complex problems, reduce waste and lead times, and leverage feedback cycles to stay on top of industry changes, customer interactions, and internal insights and strategy. Each topic and subtopic will consist of a quick description of best practices, specific examples of success and failure from the authorâ€™s experience, and an opportunity for you to jump in. Bring your toughest questions and business case challenges and we will practice agile together in real time!
