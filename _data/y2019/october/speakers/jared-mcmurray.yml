Most of your ideas suck – What are you doing about it?
Many successful companies suffer from unconscious arrogance.  It is pervasive.  We come up with ideas and assume they are awesome.  The only thing getting in the way of success (usually only measured by whether the team delivered on time) is the “factory floor”… commonly known as IT.  Product Owners/Managers are tasked with managing a backlog that contains requirements gathered from stakeholders, customer proxies, or teams of internal specialists.  They are asked to focus on outputs and dates.  In contrast, within organizations that have adopted a product mindset, Product Owners/Managers are tasked with inspiring everyone in their ecosystem (engineers, designers, leaders, etc.) to have a ridiculous passion for truly knowing their customers, quickly testing ideas before investing in building them, and aligning everyone to shared and measurable outcomes.  Jared will take a deeper dive to compare and contrast the two mindsets and the behaviors they foster.
