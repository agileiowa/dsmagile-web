title: "Monoliths & Hydras: Strategies for Goldilock Sized Service"
abstract: |
    Once upon a time a developer had a monolith with problems and said "I know, I'll use microservices"; Now they have 20 applications with problems. In this talk we will discuss applications of all sizes (without size shaming). How can we find the right size for our services? What are the strengths and weaknesses of monoliths vs microservices? How can we identify our dependencies and make data driven choices for our architecture? While this is a mostly technical talk, we will be looking more at diagrams than code. Everyone is welcome!
