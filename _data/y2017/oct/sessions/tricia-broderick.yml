title: "The Importance of Experience" 
abstract: |
    Have you ever been skeptical about something until you tried it? That is a pretty common reaction, yet, we seem to forget this when we are leading others. Tricia Broderick says that most people attempt to lecture others or simply state things like “you’re now empowered”; yet, rarely get the intended results. Join Tricia to engage first-hand in the power of using exercises to experience a key value/message. Dissect and explore interactive exercises to gain insights into self-organization, empowerment, communication, wisdom of the crowd, vulnerability, and responding to change. Leave with higher expectations and tools for helping people directly experience the power behind Agile.
