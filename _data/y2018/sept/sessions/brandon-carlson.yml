abstract: |
      Over the years more and more people have adopted Agile processes and practices to achieve better outcomes for their organizations. As with anything that goes from relative obscurity into the mainstream, many of the driving principles behind it tend to get lost in the shuffle. In response to this, one of our industry’s best, David Hussman, coined “Dude’s Law” to remind people of this drift away from the core principles behind the way we work. Join me at dsmAgile while we revisit Dude’s Law, touching on what it means today and what it can mean tomorrow.
