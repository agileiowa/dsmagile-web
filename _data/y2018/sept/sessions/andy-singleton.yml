title: An architectural approach to web services and continuous delivery
link: 
abstract: |
    The megatrend move to cloud, Web services, and continuous delivery is impacting every agile team. We will start by seeing how Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook weave these ingredients into a Matrix of Services that has created more than $3T in market value. Their tactics are quite different from the tactics applied in a Scrum-based agile transformation. They use tech leads instead of scrum masters, product managers and outcome metrics instead of product owners. Each team and service can support a matrix of different products, avoiding the silos of SAFE programs. We’ll look at basic continuous delivery tactics, and see how tools have a bigger impact than teamwork, and how they work better at large scale. We can wrap up the session with testimonials from people who are working in the new model, and have a debate on the role of teamwork in this mechanical system. Everyone should leave the session with some new ideas to try.
