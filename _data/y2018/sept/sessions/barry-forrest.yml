abstract: |
    Ever find yourself making a sour face after talking to a coworker? Wishing your team meetings felt more like an engaging social hour? There is hope. Those everyday conflicts where something seems “off” after a conversation are often related to differences in communication styles. 
    <br /><br />
    When team members understand themselves and others, there’s less conflict, more collaboration, and better working relationships. The DiSC model can help you understand why your team behaves the way it does and how to build trust for a more agile team. 
    <br /><br />
    In this interactive session, agile coaches Allison Pollard and Barry Forrest will introduce the DiSC model to explain the four behavior types that are the ingredients in any team, then explore the characteristics of these ingredients and how they react with one another. Join them to learn about the behavior styles of you and your team using DiSC, how to communicate better together, and increase trust in the team. You'll leave with a common language that your team can use to better understand themselves and adapt their behaviors with others.
