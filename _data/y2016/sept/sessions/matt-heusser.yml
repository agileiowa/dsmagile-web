title: "Agile-Test Evolution:  Changing Test Strategy Over Time"
link: /assets/presentations/2016/09/Agile_Test_Evolution_Agile_Des_Moines.pdf
abstract: > 
    After years of consulting and conferring with teams from Activate to Zappos, Matt Heusser has seen more that how teams test - he has seen how test strategy changes over time to support more ambitious development approaches. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That vantage point gave Matt the opportunity to put together a playbook - a guide to the recurring patterns of success, and failure, that he has for teams on the page of continuous improvement. Teams that moved from heavily documented process to light, to executable examples and exploration, and, for some, one-piece flow and continuous delivery tend to experiment with technique — some techniques seem to work, and others, not so much.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Come benefit from the experience of others as we discuss a move to a fluency model for Agile-Testing, with real examples. Take home ways your team might evolve … and perhaps a few things to avoid.
