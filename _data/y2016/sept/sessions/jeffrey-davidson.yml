    Are you hungry? Eat this pre-processed, fast food hamburger!<br/>
    Still hungry? Add a large order of French Fries!<br/>
    <br/>
    New to iterative software? Use Scrum!<br/>
    Tired of Scrum? Use Kanban!<br/>
    Got lots of teams? Use SAFe!<br/>
    <br/>
    We know a healthy diet values natural foods over the simplicity and ease of fast food. Similarly, many agile techniques are much more valuable than the simple, fast food version of software development everyone is teaching.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Over the last 15 years we started relying on other people's best practices instead of developing better ways of delivering software. We are using solutions developed for a different team, in a different decade, in a different company, in a different industry. There is such a rich tapestry of ways to build software and we are stuck eating software's version of fast food.

    This interactive session discusses a bunch of different Agile techniques and when they are useful. Then we will look at just how different agile might be if we picked only the most appropriate items. Lastly, you will work with a few peers to determine if you need to swap a few techniques, or even build a personalized version of Agile, specially designed to help with your situation.
