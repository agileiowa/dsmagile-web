    You've probably heard that You can't improve what you can't measure
    sible visible. From value stream mapping to burndown charts,
    making things visible is a core component of the continuous
    improvement process. Brandon Carlson says that even with all this
    visibility, much of the data surrounding how your teams work is either
    not captured or not visible, and thus represents a great opportunity
    for improvement. Imagine your management team tells you that your
    velocity is too low. Why is it too low, and what can you do about it?
    Brandon shares one team’s surprising answer to that question when they
    analyzed previously invisible data. How do you know what the highest
    risk areas of the system are for enabling the most cost effective
    regression test strategy? You'll get that answer, too. It's all there,
    tucked away where no one can see.
