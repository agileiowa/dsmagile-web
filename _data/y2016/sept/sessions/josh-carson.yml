    Are you dreading your demo days? Have you seen more slides about 'working' software than you thought possible? Is everyone just checking their emails?
    <br/> 
    <br/> 
    Demos can and should be a valuable part of your projects feedback loop. They can let you know when you've discovered something great. They can let you know when you went too far into a bad idea. They can let you know just how far away you might be from something your customers need.
    <br/> 
    <br/> 
    How often are demos something that add all that value? What about even adding any value? This session will give you the tools you need to make demos that don't suck. Learn how to spot bad demos, what key things you need in your demos, and even a bit about how to make demos that can wow your stakeholders.
