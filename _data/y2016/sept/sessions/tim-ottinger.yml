title: Intro to 4 Values of Modern Agile
abstract: | 
    We have at the seen teams evolve in line with original agile principles and modern technologies to be more exciting, more capable, more helpful, and ever more lean. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the same time, other organizations have evolved their agile practice away from the original values and principles through a series of compromises, until it has become a lifeless set of formalities.  
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We realized that the most deeply, impressively agile teams we know seem to have connected on four values.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They make people awesome, deliver value continuously, and experiment and learn rapidly. These challenging changes are only possible because of the safety that permeates their practices and culture. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Come for a re-think of agility and a challenge that may transform your experience of software development.
