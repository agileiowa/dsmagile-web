title: All Teams Are Distributed
abstract: |
   We hear it all the time: face-to-face communication is best. Co-located teams are more collaborative, more productive, more manageable. Pair programming is more efficient than code review. Mob programming—literally the whole team around one screen—may be even more efficient. This session won't try to argue that these statements aren't true in the moment, but rather that these optimizations achieve a local maximum. We will explore the limitations of co-location, and discuss distributed communication patterns that can help even mostly co-located teams achieve their global maximum.
