title: Modernizing Agile
abstract: |
    We are not practicing the same Agile we did 15 years ago. Agile at scale is mainstream.  Thousands of companies are actively seeking information on how to scale agile effectively.  There are many frameworks and techniques but they all boil down to a set of common principles.  Agile done well involves teams, programs and portfolios in a way that aligns strategy and execution.  It's important to apply a proper team foundation to build things right but without agile applied at the program and portfolio level all we may end up with is the wrong things built faster.  In this talk Julie will discuss how to effectively apply Agile to your portfolios and programs to ensure you are also building the right things.  Learn to create value, not just process.
