abstract: |
    Have you also been binge watching Narcos on Netflix?  From this portrayal we see that much of Pablo Escobar's success can be attributed to the relationships that he built and his ruthless nature.  These are qualities also key to the success of the modern Product Owner.  This session attempts a humorous comparison as well as offers an in depth discussion about the key relationships of a Product Owner and how to build them.

        Kevin focuses on a customer first approach to problem solving, preferring to get his boots dirty in the field understanding needs over white boarding in a conference room.  Farming and big data are rarely in the same sentence but Kevin brings those together in the products he delivers.

        When he's not working you may find him on the side of the road cursing the British engineers responsible for his carâ€™s(MGB) most recent demise.  He has also perfected the "agile oil change": add oil in faster than it can leak out, but never all at once.
