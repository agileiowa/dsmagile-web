title: First You Build the Team, Then They Build the Thing
abstract: |
    Behind every awesome product is a team who trusts one another and works well together. This is the positive case of Conway’s Law, in which a system is a reflection of the organization that built it. At the other extreme is a system built by a team whose members are distrustful, do not collaborate, and are ultimately dysfunctional. The resulting product will inevitably fail its customers. Adding and revamping features to such a product would be dressing up a rotten egg. 
    <br/> 
    <br/> 
    Rather, we must form a healthy team in order to have a healthy product. How do we do that? How do we find the “right” people; bring them together and ensure the outcome is a great product? 
    <br/> 
    <br/> 
    In this talk, we’ll explore 5 (not so easy) tips about doing just that. We’ll inject thinking from past and present leaders; and leverage Lean & Agile principles, to build and sustain a healthy team.
