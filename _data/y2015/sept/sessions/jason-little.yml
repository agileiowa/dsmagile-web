    You want to be Spotify because you saw those fancy videos about how awesome they are. The problem is, Spotify was built that way from the ground up and you need to undo years, or sometimes decades, of organizational debt to get there. The Agile community likes to say you must adopt the agile mindset or 'be more agile', but what the heck does that mean? In this session I'll show you how to figure out how to build a bridge from where you're at to where you want to get to.

          Jason began his career as a web developer when Cold Fusion roamed the earth. Over the following years, he moved into management, Agile Coaching and consulting. The bumps and bruises collected along the way brought him to the realization that helping organizations adopt Agile practices was less about the practices, and all about change.
          <br/><br/>
          In 2008 he attended an experiential learning conference about how people experience change and since then, heâ€™s been writing, and speaking, all over the world about helping organizations discover more effective practices for managing organizational change. He is the author of Lean Change Management and an international speaker who has spoken all over the world from Canada, the US, Finland, Germany, Australia, Belgium and more.
