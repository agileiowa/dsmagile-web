    Stop me if you've heard this one:
    <br/><br/>
    Q: What did the developer say to the users in the changelog?
    A: Minor bug fixes and enhancements.
    <br/><br/>
    Whoops, sorry, that's not a joke. It is unfortunately common, though. Far too often, changes in software and websites are communicated to users with a cavalier attitude — if it all. In this workshop, you'll learn why it's important to communicate clearly about change, why we often don't, and how to do it better.
    <br/><br/>
    Attendees will learn a three-step framework for communicating about change with users and customers. We'll also explore three advanced techniques to ease user concerns—and even turn them to your advantage—during substantial or controversial changes to your sites, apps, and services. We'll walk through design exercises that help us learn to think chronologically and contextually and communicate change with greater clarity.
    <br/><br/>
    You'll leave with a greater appreciation for how UI, UX, content, and copywriting interconnect in the delicate art of moving someone's digital cheese.
