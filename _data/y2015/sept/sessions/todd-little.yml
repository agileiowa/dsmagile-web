title: "7 Sins of Scrum and other Agile Anti-Patterns"

abstract: |
    This is about agile “anti-patterns”: “something that looks like a good idea, but which backfires badly when applied” (Coplien). Todd has been around agile development from before it was called agile.   In that time, he’s seen teams fall into the trap of many of these anti-patterns, becoming stuck without ever realizing it. Frequently, this is due to a dogmatic understanding of what is right and wrong about Scrum and agile development. The first step to getting unstuck is to be able to detect these “sins”; I aim to expose teams to these common pitfalls and then also provide a vision for a virtuous path to take them to the Promised Land.
