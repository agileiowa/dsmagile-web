    “We have mastered the agile principles and are thriving….wait our team members just changed and the business unit just reorganized! What do we do now?” Sound familiar? Often a team goes through training, becomes adjusted to the new way of working, and starts moving along well using agile principles to guide them through software development. This snapshot-in-time does not always last past one or two projects; then something affects the team—team members being added, leaving, moving to other teams; new management, new users. What should you do? How do you adjust? Should you consider training, role adjustments, look to team members to be accountable for knowledge transfer? Lisa provides insight to help you explore ways to address change, whether it is on your team or at the enterprise level, to assist in sustaining agile practices and momentum.  She shares successes through personal experiences in a large, ever-changing organization.
