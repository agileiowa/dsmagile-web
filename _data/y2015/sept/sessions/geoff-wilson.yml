    A few years ago, Geoff Wilson was in a tough spot. His digital product development agency, 352 Inc., was growing quickly but was barely managing to keep up with the workload. Projects were disorganized. Employee morale was low. Customers were frustrated. Geoff needed to do something fast. 
    <br/><br/>
    Geoff and his leadership team restructured the agency into cross-functional agile teams and turned managers into servant leaders. Teams were taught Lean Startup techniques and traditional processes were thrown out the window. The changes dramatically increased innovation, quality, customer satisfaction and employee morale - almost overnight.
    <br/><br/>
    Geoff will share his story and belief that every organization can achieve similar results when its leaders learn to barely manage at all.

        President and Founder of digital product development agency 352 Inc., Geoff Wilson is a tech entrepreneur, investor and mentor who found his passion for business at an early age. After starting a successful computer store in high school, Geoff began building websites in his college fraternity house room and 352 Inc. was born. 17 years later, his digital product development agency has grown to more than 85 employees with offices in Atlanta, Tampa and Gainesville, FL. 
        <br/><br/>
        As 352 grew, Geoff began to focus on the powerful impact of lean and agile methodologies. Geoff implemented these principles into 352 by reorganizing the agency into cross-functional teams and turning managers into servant leaders. Free to focus on a single project at a time, his teams’ quality of work, productivity and morale dramatically increased. Good client relationships became great ones, and 352 began down a path of unprecedented growth. Geoff calls his management philosophy "Barely Manage to Lead" and speaks at conferences about how this approach can improve any type of business.

        Geoff and his wife, Kim Wilson, also have built and sold a highly successful digital product, SocialNewsDesk. SocialNewsDesk is an online social media management platform for newsrooms, and is currently being used by 85% of the television newsrooms in the United States to manage their social presence. SocialNewsDesk was acquired in 2014 by a Fortune 500 company, Graham Holdings.

        Geoff's success lead him to be named one of America’s Top 30 Young Entrepreneurs by INC Magazine, and the University of Florida Warrington College of Business’ Entrepreneur of the Year.
