abstract: |
    Are you a product owner seeking to be more value-driven?  Do you work with product owners who you would like to be more value-driven? Are you struggling with ways to make that happen?  Do you like to play games?  If so, come play the Product Owner Value Game and experience what value driven backlog refinement look like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had the opportunity to play the Product Owner Value Game  created by Dajo Breddels and Paul Kuijten, at Agile2015 and wanted to share it with the Agile Iowa Community.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Weâ€™ll play the <a href="http://www.povaluegame.org/">Product Owner Value Game</a>, and then discuss what playing the game tells us about backlog refinement, sequencing and value based decisions.
