title: "So what do we do with the architects?" 
abstract: |
    You’ve made the switch to agile. You stopped doing comprehensive documentation and you have self directed teams that value emergent design right?. Then you notice that you forgot to give the architects something to do. Architecture is an activity that all teams need to perform and you might just have some experienced individuals around to help lead and guide them. In this presentation we will talk about what software architecture is, how teams accomplish it, and where the people traditionally called “architects” fit in an agile world.
