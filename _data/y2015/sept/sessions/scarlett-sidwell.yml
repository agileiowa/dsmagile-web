abstract: |
    That's right.  The Real World.  This is not a high level, philosophical lecture about the ideal implementation of UX.  I will share real stories of how I've convinced project stakeholders and managers to take UX seriously, and integrate UX into their project lifecycle.  This session will take an in depth look at field studies you can begin to implement at your place of business, tomorrow, including dos and don'ts, how to get participants, and how to be successful in the implementation of each field study.
