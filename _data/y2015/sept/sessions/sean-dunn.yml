abstract: |
    Great attention has been placed on transitioning organizations towards Agile values, principles and practices, but what are we doing today to ensure that these gains are sustainable well beyond our own tenure?

Sean leverages his 13 years in the Canadian Army to translate lessons in building sustainable organizations – and along the way, questioning some common Agile practices.
