title: "Wicked Problems, and How To <s>Solve</s> Work Through Them" 
abstract: |
    We’ve all run into problems that were more than just complicated—no matter what you do, the problem shifts and there seems to be no perfect, or maybe even right, solution.  Those are a special class of problem, called wicked problems, and they crop up in pretty much every field, from business to urban planning to public policy. The bad news is, wicked problems can’t truly ever be solved. The good news is, they can be addressed, or treated. Being able to address wicked problems in way that is both sound and legitimate is a practice that can save your team or organization lots of unexpected conflict and working at cross-purposes. Warning: it’s not just about generating buy-in and definitely not just getting to yes, but about surfacing crucial underlying tensions that have to be faced and worked through in order to take action that will be consistent with your organization’s identity, values, and mission. The Kettering Foundation’s Amy Lee specializes in wicked public problems, and has worked with Luke Hohmann of Conteneo to create a decision making structure that will allow your team or organization to frame and deliberate on any wicked problem, either in-person or online. Amy will be explaining both what wicked problems are how to address them, focusing on the tendency to try to avoid the tensions and hard choices that are an intrinsic to these kind of problems.
