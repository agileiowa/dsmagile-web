title: A Lean Startup Case Study
abstract: |
    This session will explore a real-life case study in implementing principles from the popular book, The Lean Startup, by Eric Ries.  In 2014 FunnelWise, a Des Moines area software startup, set out with the goal of interviewing at least 100 prospective customers before designing their first product.  Over the course of the year, they ultimately held over 200 meetings and interviews to gather information from their target audience, and what they learned shaped the vision for a compelling new product.  Join this session to hear the story and to learn how to apply the methodology to your own projects.

        Matt previously founded and grew Submittal Exchange, a provider of web-based collaboration tools for commercial construction projects.  In a five year period, Matt grew the company from two employees to more than 100 and more than 100,000 users of their software.  He sold Submittal Exchange to Textura Corporation (NYSE: TXTR) in 2011 and remained its president.  He served on the executive team at Textura when the company completed a successful IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013.  Matt chose to leave Textura so he could pursue several new entrepreneurial ventures, and in January 2014 he founded FunnelWise, a provider of marketing and sales alignment software.  After spending a year interviewing prospective customers and designing their solution, Matt and the FunnelWise team recently launched their first product.
