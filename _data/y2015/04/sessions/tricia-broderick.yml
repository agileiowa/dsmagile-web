title: "Fostering Agility:  What's needed outside the teams"
abstract: |
    Do you feel like your teams are practicing agile, yet high performance is missing?  Most organizations start off strong in their transformation toward an agile mindset.  They successfully implement various team practices, such as sprints and stand-ups. However after the initial wave of benefits, a plateau or even a slip back all too often occurs. This is because many leaders do not focus on fostering sustained agilityâ€•that is, creating an overall environment that influences individuals and teams to be learning focused. Tricia Broderick explores topics including the missed opportunities to inspire people to go outside their comfort zones, the mixed messages we send with performance reviews, and overlooked chances to develop change agents. Join Tricia to learn several key initiatives outside the teams that nurture learning, quality, innovation, and job satisfaction.
