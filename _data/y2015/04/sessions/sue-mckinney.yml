title: "Agile in the Large: Simplicity to Address Complexity"
abstract: |
    Why do some agile transformations succeed and some fail? Most often it is the culture that refuses to change or changes comes too slowly. Sue McKinney led the agile transformation of 1500 engineers world-wide at Symantec with notable results in just 3 months! Her ‘pilot’ project required 22 scrum teams. Sue will talk about her experiences with the turn around and how she utilized the basic tenets of Agile and Lean for adoption and how she addressed the culture change also required for successful adoption at scale.
