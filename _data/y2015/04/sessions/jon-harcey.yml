title: "The Power of Story Mapping"
abstract: |
    So, you have an idea that you want to build…Do you know how big that idea is? Do you know what order to build it in? Do you know all the ways a user will interact with it? Do you know how it will interact with other systems? In this session, we’ll go through an exercise in story mapping to show how it is one of the most powerful tools to help you visualize the system, explore user and system interactions, determine the order to build it, and create user stories to work from.
