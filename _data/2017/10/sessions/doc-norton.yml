      bio: |
        Once a dedicated code slinger, Doc has turned his energy toward helping teams, departments, and companies work better together in the pursuit of better software.
        <br/><br/>
        An agile practitioner and coach since 1999, Doc's 20-plus years of software development experience have provided him with exposure to a wide range of topics. Doc declares expertise in no single language or methodology and is immediately suspicious of anyone who declares such expertise.  
        <br/><br/>
        A frequent speaker, Doc is passionate about helping others become better developers, working with teams to improve delivery, and building great organizations.
