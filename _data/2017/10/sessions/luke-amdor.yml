title: "\"We'll do it live!\": Monitoring and Debugging in Production"
abstract: |
  That big "P" word: Production. That new piece of shiny code you just wrote with a hundred percent test coverage goes ka-put once it's deployed. 
  What's broken, and why? Sometimes the errors are a little more subtle, lying and growing there until 
  you reach the right conditions. Either way, when users experience problems, it's not good. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maybe we need to check our assumptions a bit and figure out how to lower 
  the risk if things go sideways. We'll go over my experience in a highly regulated industry 
  to apply the OODA loop, continuous delivery, ownership, observability, and others to embrace 
  failure to lower risk of production incidents.

        Luke Amdor is a Principal Staff Engineer at Banno / Jack Henry and Associates where he 
        leads the Infrastructure team. Banno began as a startup many years ago entering the financial 
        technology services space. Three and a half years ago, this small Iowa start-up was acquired 
        by Jack Henry and Associates, a S&P 400 publicly traded company with over 5,000 employees. 
        Banno has continued to grow and thrive to be a remote-first business unit over almost 150

        associates.

        He's a person of many hats: having been an agile developer for 10+ years, 
        he now focuses more on the infrastructure side of the world and 
        figuring out how to empower development teams to deliver their best. He's currently 
        interested in the Kubernetes ecosystem and cloud native technologies.
