      bio: | 
        Diane Zajac-Woodie (@agilesquirrel) has spent more than six years redefining the business analyst role as more than a requirements dictator. Through open and honest conversations, Diane guides her business partners toward creative solutions that solve problems and eliminate waste. She shares this same approach with her technical teams, facilitating communication, cooperation, and continuous learning to ensure success. Diane craves knowledge almost as much as chocolate and could make question-asking an Olympic sport.
        <br/><br/>
        Now an agile coach, Diane's recent passion is to free those mired in the status quo even if she has to pull them out one at a time. Diane's alter ego makes her thoughts transparent on her blog, <a href="http://agilesquirrel.blogspot.com">AgileSquirrel</a>.
