    If you want to stop building useless software, then you have to start understanding your customers.  Unfortunately there’s no magic trick for reading their minds. But there is a simple technique that can help you gain insights and build empathy for them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Empathy mapping is a simple activity for your team, stakeholders and anyone else who is responsible for delivering products and services. It allows you to collectively explore what your customers see, hear, say & do, as well as consider what they think and feel. This leads to insights about their pain and potential wants which are the keys to building more useful software.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In this session, Diane guides you through building an empathy map, showing you how to use silent brainstorming to encourage everyone to contribute. You will see, first-hand, how easy it is to work collaboratively to create a shared understanding of the customer. And that is the first step to start building software that customers find useful.
