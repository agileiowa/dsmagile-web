title: "Agile Numbers: The Signposts on Your Agile Journey"
link: 
abstract: |
    When I first saw the infamous Deloitte Agile Landscape diagram, I wondered how did agile get so complicated. The second thought was a question: ‘how can I inspect those techniques and practices and choose the right ones for my team?’. 
    <br/><br/>
    In this session, I’ll talk about how empirical data (which I’m calling agile numbers) can serve as signposts on our journey to reach the goal of delivering customer value faster with maximum reliability and minimum issues. I’ll show how agile numbers can help us determine if a practice is worth the investment and whether it will improve our team’s performance. I will also share examples of agile numbers that can assist you in your agile journey. Those numbers are pulled from different sources like scientific studies, research from Google, and the 2017 State of DevOps Report.

        Akrem would describe himself as a “technologist” interested in the different facets of software delivery. Those facets include writing code, automating infrastructure, continuous integration, continuous delivery, agile practices, and figuring out what makes high-performing teams come into existence from a collection of individuals. Like many developers, he got his first taste of professional programming with PHP and Java and the latter still has a special place in his heart even after branching into C#, Scala, Groovy and Python. His latest adventures are in AWS-land wearing the DevOps hat. Akrem currently plies his trade with Source Allies, Inc out of Urbandale, IA which is dedicated to helping its partners grow and become more productive through creative and open technology solutions.
