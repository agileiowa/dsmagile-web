abstract: |
    You work in an organization that struggles to prioritize work. 
    There are too many handoffs to get things done. 
    Issues snowball downhill, impacting what teams deliver.
    You feel blocked by issues above your paygrade.
    <br/><br/>
    Sound familiar?
    <br/><br/>
    Come join Matt Barcomb as he introduces Strategy Deployment, Portfolio Planning, and Organization Design. He will explore how these topics are interrelated, as well as their typical organizational impacts.
    <br/><br/>
    Attendees will leave equipped with practices to sense these impacts and build the business cases needed to influence senior leadership—no matter where you may fall in the soul-crushing hierarchy of your organization.
