title: Building and Sustaining Anti-Fragile Teams 
link:
abstract: |
    How does your team deal with stress and change? Does it cause them to fall apart, or are they able to adapt? What if you were able to create a team that is antifragile; one that actually grows stronger through experiencing stress and change? Antifragile is the opposite of fragile. Antifragile teams go beyond resilience and use those stressors and uncertainty to further develop and flourish. The move toward antifragility creates a learning culture and has a positive impact on business outcomes.
 
    In this session, we will explore the difference between fragile, robust, and antifragile teams and how to move your team toward antifragility. You’ll understand how to diagnose the current state of your team by observing key behaviors and responses to change. You’ll also discover approaches that you can use on your teams, regardless of where they are now, to make them more robust and even antifragile.
