title: You brain is broken and you’re bad at making decisions – Why Agile thinking can help you
link: 
abstract: |
    The human brain is really good at lots of things, but living and making decisions in our modern world typically isn't one of them. Learn about some of the ways our brain works less than optimally in decision making scenarios and how to stack the deck in favor of not totally messing things up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After exploring some of these concepts (they're features, not bugs, am I right?) we'll talk about why thinking in increments and iterations, and using empirical decision making can help us be more awesome.
