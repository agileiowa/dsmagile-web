          <p>
            What keeps your best ideas from reaching escape velocity? Constraint come in many forms like process bloat, corporate hierarchies and bright shiny technologies are just a few gravity wells we face. If product and customer learning are the obvious target of uncertainty and value, why do we add baggage that inhibits learning and how does it keep sneaking in to our companies and teams? This talk will challenge you to examine which things you can jettison that allow for your innovations to lift off and move you towards your next best investment instead of being sucked down to planet old school, again.

          <p>
          The IT group at Western Governors University (WGU) was under incredible pressure. They were tasked with driving innovation, producing significant improvements in operational performance and building credibility – and do this nearly immediately while handling a complete application refresh and dealing with rapid growth. To produce the desired results, the group took a four-pronged approach: They used Agile to improve project results. They relied on Lean to improve internal processes. They rigorously aligned and rationalized the portfolio to the university and market. They created a culture of trust and ownership. The net result was a dramatic increase in throughput and innovation. In this session, Niel Nickolaisen explains the tools WGU used to transform IT.

          <p>Einstein is credited with saying: "In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not."  Not surprisingly the theories about scaling agile methods exhibit the same properties. This session will discuss the topic of Scaling Agile. Why certain patterns prevail and how those patterns can change when they confront the realities of "practice".</p>

          <p>Scrum and metrics have not always gotten along. Usually, when metrics are brought up it is at a manager or executives request to see how a product is progressing and if the deadline and budget will be met, or worse, unmet/exceeded.</p>

          <p>Most of today's Agile Lifecycle Management (ALM) tools have a multitude of different metrics to show just about anything you can think of from burndowns to burnups, cycle time to work in progress and beyond. But do Scrum teams really know what these metrics mean and do management, ScrumMasters and the teams know how to properly utilize them to determine important trends to aid in inspection and adaption?</p>

          <p>Metrics: Not Just for Managers Anymore will explore how to teach teams to interpret and appreciate what their metrics are showing them. It will look at how to improve metrics by modifying practices and modify practices by improving the metrics.</p>

          <p>We know that teams and individuals that take ownership of their work out perform those that don’t, often by 50%! For high performance teams, ownership is essential. But, leaders struggle letting their teams take ownership. Why? They are afraid if they trust their teams, they will not take ownership and fail. Leaders must create a culture of trust and help their teams take ownership. But what if the team builds the wrong product? Teams must align with the strategy and purpose of the business as well as value to the customer. Finally, the organization must deal honestly with ambiguity. Uncertainty is the new normal.
</p>
<p>How do teams, individuals and leaders address these issues? Pollyanna provides you with the tools to create a culture of trust by dealing with fear of collaboration; helping teams take ownership through asking questions and not giving answers (“How do you want to solve it?”); aligning with the business by using decision filters based on a business value conversation; and finally, helping teams show real progress and not committing until all risks are within an acceptable range.</p>

<p>In the world of software development, estimation challenges exist on multiple fronts. Teams are faced with estimating value, cost, and/or schedule at the task, story, project, and/or portfolio level. There are some agile practices that claim to help with estimation, including not doing estimation at all, but still many agile projects are challenged. In this session Todd will look into some of the reasons for these challenges by exploring a number of myths of software estimation and then setting out to validate or bust these myths. Learn what the real data says, not what some pundit says should be true.
Some of the myths that will be explored include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Historical Estimation Accuracy
<li> Relative Estimation
<li> The Cone of Uncertainty
<li> Velocity
<li> Scope Creep
<li> Wisdom of Crowds

          <p>Continuous Delivery can be a hard concept for many people coming into agile. The act of continuously pushing new code into production on a regular basis can be scary. For many people the idea is so far out-there they think they couldn’t possibly achieve it and never try. This presentation will focus on different techniques for practicing continuous delivery while still controlling the end user experience and managing risk. We will look at how to manage multi-sprint “epics”, target selective groups for rollout, and protect the end users from “too much” change.</p>

          <p>
          Teams often talk a great deal about how projects need to deliver “business value”, but what does that really mean? The true use of business value in projects is to determine what to deliver and in what order. Teams may try to quantify their business value but that activity may be entirely unnecessary. Kent describes a set of techniques that teams use to guide their conversations to determine if they are building the right thing in the right order to solve a problem that is worth solving. He will also talk about how the conversation ends in decisions about how to proceed and the metrics that demonstrate the value is delivered.

          <p>Pair Programming is widely recommended as a good agile practice, but are you reaping the rewards?
Has your organization adopted pair programming as an everyday accepted practice or is there a perception that it is too difficult to justify? Perhaps management approves of pair programming but the developers don't buy-in. Is pair programming too extreme for you? This session explores how to support and encourage pair programming, identifies the value pair programming provides to the business, and describes how developers can realize the maximum benefits from pair programming.</p>

	  <p>According to a Standish group study, 64 percent of features in a given software system are rarely—or never—used. How does this happen? Today, the work of eliciting the customers' true needs, which remains elusive, can be enhanced using data-driven requirements techniques.

Brandon introduces some of the reasons why identifying customer needs is so difficult and how you can improve them using techniques that you can employ on your projects right away. Find out how to instrument existing applications and develop new requirements based on operational profiles of the current system. Learn to use A/B testing—a technique for trying out and analyzing alternative implementations—on your current system to determine which new features will deliver the most business value. With these tools and others at hand, you can help users and business stakeholders decide the best approaches and best new features to meet their real needs. Now is the time to take the guesswork out of requirements and get the facts.</a></b></h4>

</p>
<p>
Users Stories, the tool teams use to break ideas into small chunks of deliverable work, are easy to describe and challenging to write. This session is about writing great user stories and acceptance criteria by ensuring everyone on the team knows what needs to be done. We will discuss what elements should be included and which ones are optional; why the size of your user story is important and how to make them smaller; and the structure for better acceptance criteria.</p>
