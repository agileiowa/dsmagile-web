            <p>Time crunches in software projects aren't going away anytime soon. Previous technical debt is taking its toll, the project is taking longer than anticipated, and the next project is coming down the pipe. As if that isn't enough, you just been told that the project needs to finish sooner! Don't panic. In this session we'll discuss handling this situation with poise and positive action to help choose the better technical debt to take on, make sure you know how you will improve it, and help you on the path to the architecture you ultimately want.

            <p>We all think of ourselves as pretty smart. After all, we sent a man to the moon and can instantly send a message across the world. Unfortunately, we suffer from a nasty little thing known as the Overconfidence Effect, a bias that applies to almost everything we do, including judging our own intelligence. Overconfidence is one of the dozens of documented biases and shortcomings in human judgment and decision making. Brandon Carlson covers biases from the Availability heuristic, which causes us to associate an event’s probability with its memorability, to the Affect heuristic, where a positive experience compels us to believe that the decision was good—regardless of the overall outcome. Brandon explains that understanding and planning for these biases can help reduce the impact they have on our daily decisions. We still may not be as smart as we think, but at least we have the tools to compensate.

            <h4><b>How to Build the Wrong Thing Faster and Learn From It</b></h4>
            <p>For years we’ve worked hard at software development. As teams establish better flow in software development, refactoring language, not just code, presents itself as a meaningful evolution. Where flow lives, could "software development" be refactored to "product development"? The brave pioneers that are already doing this (and there are more each day) are learning that building the product is much less clear than simply getting work done. The land of product development is filled with holes or ambiguity and laced with land mines of wrongness. Ideas that you are certain about often fizzle or change when you watch someone interact with your product. Being overly certain or overly focusing on "just getting work done" are weak weapons in a place where being wrong, and learning from it, is a vital part of finding your way to success.
<br/><br/>
Instead of talking about "why you should do agile," let’s explore "why you should think in product," assuming you are using some agile practices. Our journey will explore the messy, sloppy and non-linear aspects or product development. Along the way, we’ll investigate how software construction is important but courageously failing and learning in product is essential. We’ll look at how teams are producing more real product value with less code. We will also peer into the world of program level development, where collections of teams produce product without injecting incidental complexity by employing what you might call "test driven product."
<br/><br/>
Who knows, toward the end of the journey, we might even rally to refactor the agile manifesto to read, "Learning in Product over Simply Getting Things Done."

            <p>As companies introduce agile practices, the Business Analyst role is often left by the wayside. The title does not even exist in Scrum or other specific agile implementations, leaving many Business Analysts wondering where they fit in. But fear not! The skills of a good BA are even more valuable in an agile environment! Join Diane Zajac-Woodie as she tells the tale of a new agile team, struggling with no formal training, a resistant corporate culture and unwilling team members. She shares how this team benefited from the communication, collaboration and facilitation skills of an experienced BA. She goes on to highlight some specific shifts that Business Analysts can make in order to help their own team’s transition. These include using story maps and writing executable requirements, just in time. Embracing their new roles, BAs can also encourage team members to cross role boundaries. This leads to new skill acquisition and a more cohesive team, which ultimately leads to higher quality software and happier customers.

            <p>What is an Agile leader?  In traditional organizations leaders often assign work, design systems, solve problems, make decisions, and write performance appraisals.  In fact, many traditional leaders achieved lofty titles by exhibiting technical expertise or by proving effective at directing the work of individuals, teams, and departments.  Agile leadership is different.  In this session, learn of skills and behaviors that will help the leader remain relevant in an Agile organization.  This session includes a includes a workshop where leaders tackle issues and situations that are common to Agile teams but are different from what many consider traditional challenges.  Attendees are encouraged to bring ideas for discussion topics that could include their experiences, relevant challenges and observations.

In 2014 FunnelWise, a Des Moines area software startup, set out with the goal of interviewing at least 100 prospective customers before designing their first product.  Over the course of the year, they ultimately held over 200 meetings and interviews to gather information from their target audience, and what they learned shaped the vision for a compelling new product.

            <p>You have been tapped for an exciting new project. A member of the executive team recognizes that the company needs to transform to meet the evolving needs of your dynamic marketplace. They know that Agile will be part of that transformation, they tap you to lead the effort, and now they think their work is done . While that is exciting and an honor for you, you still need the active engagement of the senior leadership team to create a culture where Agile practices can flourish. The support from the top is critical to drive the type of innovation and flexibility that will be required to successfully implement any new idea – but especially one as (positively) disruptive as Agile.
<br/><br/>
In this interactive session, Heather and Kent describe how senior leaders need to act differently in an enterprise transitioning to agile, and some helpful patterns individual contributors can use to leverage politics in a positive manner to lead up through influence and help senior leaders make the transition. These patterns are based on Heather and Kent’s experiences at a variety of organizations driving or helping to drive changes including, but not limited to adopting agile approaches. Along the way, we’ll give you a chance to share your thoughts and experiences using politics in a positive (or perhaps not so positive) way to help an enterprise transition to agile.

            <p>Do you feel like your teams are practicing agile, yet high performance is missing?  Most organizations start off strong in their transformation toward an agile mindset.  They successfully implement various team practices, such as sprints and stand-ups. However after the initial wave of benefits, a plateau or even a slip back all too often occurs. This is because many leaders do not focus on fostering sustained agility―that is, creating an overall environment that influences individuals and teams to be learning focused. Tricia Broderick explores topics including the missed opportunities to inspire people to go outside their comfort zones, the mixed messages we send with performance reviews, and overlooked chances to develop change agents. Join Tricia to learn several key initiatives outside the teams that nurture learning, quality, innovation, and job satisfaction.
