            <p>Much of what we've learned about management and motivation isn't necessarily wrong, it's just inappropriate and ineffective for knowledge work. Knowledge work requires creativity and adaptability. To create a truly impactful knowledge work environment, you need to use appropriate leadership styles and create an environment that allows people to achieve their highest potential. Doc takes a look at types of work, the management styles that work best for them, and the qualities necessary to create a high-performing creative culture.

            <p>Common Agile practice leaves out a critical piece of work. This talk is about how teams are working to put it back.
<br/>
<br/>
If Agile development is working in your organization, you’ve probably seen that you can get pretty high quality software out predictably – every two weeks or so. But, you’ve probably noticed that choosing exactly what to build is a problem. And, that even when the choice gets made, you often still end up building software that doesn’t get used.   
<br/>
<br/>
Some organizations, maybe yours, have started to include discovery approaches. Processes like Lean Startup, Lean UX, and Design Thinking help us identify problems and solutions, and then test them before fully investing in them. But, “discovery” can be relegated to the phase ahead of development that everyone is waiting for and that only a few people get to participate in.
<br/>
<br/>
Learn how contemporary teams combine both discovery and delivery work within the same team. Jeff will share concepts and examples of teams making this messy process work.

            <p>The growing emphasis on "Individuals and Interactions" yields tremendous rewards, but not without risk.  Teams who work together increasingly find themselves in situations where they NEED to have sensitive and high risk conversations, but don't always know how to approach those discussions.  
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows about some of the biggest challenges that face a team.  They are also aware of the many ways the corrective conversation that can go awry.
<br/>
<br/>
These conversations are often indefinitely delayed.  Opportunities for growth are missed and resentment grows.  
<br/>
<br/>
Attend this session to learn how to be the agent of change your team needs with techniques and practices to help you master crucial conversations.

Maybe we need to check our assumptions a bit and figure out how to lower 
the risk if things go sideways. We'll go over my experience in a highly regulated industry 
to apply the OODA loop, continuous delivery, ownership, observability, and others to embrace 
failure to lower risk of production incidents.

<br/>
<br/>
If you want to stop building useless software, then you have to start understanding your customers.  Unfortunately there’s no magic trick for reading their minds. But there is a simple technique that can help you gain insights and build empathy for them.
<br/>
<br/>
Empathy mapping is a simple activity for your team, stakeholders and anyone else who is responsible for delivering products and services. It allows you to collectively explore what your customers see, hear, say & do, as well as consider what they think and feel. This leads to insights about their pain and potential wants which are the keys to building more useful software.
<br/>
<br/>
In this session, Diane guides you through building an empathy map, showing you how to use silent brainstorming to encourage everyone to contribute. You will see, first-hand, how easy it is to work collaboratively to create a shared understanding of the customer. And that is the first step to start building software that customers find useful.

            <p>How does your team deal with stress and change? Does it cause them to fall apart, or are they able to adapt? What if you were able to create a team that is antifragile; one that actually grows stronger through experiencing stress and change? Antifragile is the opposite of fragile. Antifragile teams go beyond resilience and use those stressors and uncertainty to further develop and flourish. The move toward antifragility creates a learning culture and has a positive impact on business outcomes.

In this session, we will explore the difference between fragile, robust, and antifragile teams and how to move your team toward antifragility. You’ll understand how to diagnose the current state of your team by observing key behaviors and responses to change. You’ll also discover approaches that you can use on your teams, regardless of where they are now, to make them more robust and even antifragile.

<ul>Learning outcomes:
    <li>Understand the prerequisites to coaching for antifragility</li>
    <li>Develop a specific plan to move your team toward antifragility</li>
    <li>Understand the key to sustaining an antifragile team</li>

<br/><br/>
In this session, I’ll talk about how empirical data (which I’m calling agile numbers) can serve as signposts on our journey to reach the goal of delivering customer value faster with maximum reliability and minimum issues. I’ll show how agile numbers can help us determine if a practice is worth the investment and whether it will improve our team’s performance. I will also share examples of agile numbers that can assist you in your agile journey. Those numbers are pulled from different sources like scientific studies, research from Google, and the 2017 State of DevOps Report.

            <p>Product Managers are the CEO of the company, and they can make or break the company. However, most times we are not the CEO of the company, but we are the “owner” of some part of the overall product the customer uses. But what does the mini CEO do? What should we focus on each day? What are the skills we need to become closer to the CEO? 
<br/><br/>
Follow Chad on his journey as an Agile Coach, being the co-owner and co-manager of his wife’s cupcake business, and leading a team of product owners at at Salesforce. Chad will share how each of these roles have all helped him understand the role of a Product Manager much better and how to succeed at it. Pick up top three habits you can do each day to stay on top of your PO game, the top four skills you should have or work toward, and the metrics you should track as the “owner” of your product.

            <p>The human brain is really good at lots of things, but living and making decisions in our modern world typically isn't one of them. Learn about some of the ways our brain works less than optimally in decision making scenarios and how to stack the deck in favor of not totally messing things up.
<br/>
<br/>
After exploring some of these concepts (they're features, not bugs, am I right?) we'll talk about why thinking in increments and iterations, and using empirical decision making can help us be more awesome.

            <p>Jimmy Buffett taught us about the sadness of being a pirate, 200 hundred years too late.  But, what if everything that pirate does now is the same as what we do in our agile software development world?

See the things that have worked and did not work in those years and how a group of people have settled into a comfort zone in and out of agile ideas.

            <p>To accomplish anything, you need the help of others and others need your help. Successful teams have members that are continually improving how they interact and communicate with each other. Collaboration, creativity, influence, and results grow out of an environment that is positive and affirming.
<br/> 
<br/> 
In this highly interactive and fun session, Kupe, an improvisational actor, focuses on key improvisation lessons that will help you be a more attentive and flexible team member. You will walk away with lessons to help you improve the following skills – communication, collaboration, relationship building, negotiating, influencing, critical thinking, leadership. And your ability to gain buy-in, earn trust, and to make high velocity, quality decisions. The Improv Advantage will help you and your team go the extra mile and separate from the rest!
<br/> 
<br/> 
In his book, To Sell is Human, Daniel Pink highlights improvisation as a critical skill for everyone. With Kupe’s improv, IT and business background, he will be able to help you directly apply these skills on the job. Improv to Improve.

            <p>Have you ever been skeptical about something until you tried it? That is a pretty common reaction, yet, we seem to forget this when we are leading others. Tricia Broderick says that most people attempt to lecture others or simply state things like “you’re now empowered”; yet, rarely get the intended results. Join Tricia to engage first-hand in the power of using exercises to experience a key value/message. Dissect and explore interactive exercises to gain insights into self-organization, empowerment, communication, wisdom of the crowd, vulnerability, and responding to change. Leave with higher expectations and tools for helping people directly experience the power behind Agile.
