              <p>Hey everyone. I have been a developer, tester, product person, and almost all the Scrum roles now at John Deere over the past 10 years. My focus has been on making sure all the distributed pieces and their teams can all function and work together so that the end customer has an experience worth using. Most recently, I have become the John Deere API Guy. This means that I now focusing on finding ways to get multiple companies to function and work together.
<br/><br/>
Outside of work, I continually focus on improvement. How can we maintain the house better? How can we write a better research paper? How can we make sure this Dungeons and Dragons adventure is more engaging to the players? How can we get this AI to finally beat a player at a specific board game? I believe there is no perfect and everything can be made better. I try to live that both at work and in my personal life.

            <h4><b>Agile and Scrum at the Speed of Light</b></h4>
            
            <p>Cleveland’s GiveCamp is the most magical, tiring, and worthwhile 48 hours anyone will
experience professionally. For example, in 2015, 200 techies volunteered their talents and passion to
help 19 non-profits with projects including data collection, websites, GPS-enabled mobile app, an
educational online game, and database applications. How does so much work get done in such little
amount of time? Agile in hyperdrive – standups every 4 hours, adhoc swarming with heavy hitter devs
roaming the projects, and lots of free food and drinks to keep everyone fortified.
<br/><br/>
This case study reviews how so much work gets done in such a short amount of time. Each GiveCamp
weekend consists of 48 hours to developer, complete, and hand-off the sites or apps to the nonprofit to
be self-sufficient in using and maintaining it thereafter. The organizations are prepped to have a Product
Owner on site the entire weekend sitting right there with the techies on the team, ready to make
decisions on the spot and keep development moving forward. If something isn’t working – the team can
immediately pivot. A lot of intriguing functionality came from asking “it would be great if our site
could…”. A scrummaster attends standup every 4 hours, teamwork reigns as everyone maps out the
stories to accomplish the goal, and pairing and collaboration amongst everyone is key. It helps that the
location, hyped up wifi, office supplies RedBull, coffee, ice cream, and all meals and beverages are
donated by local companies to keep the teams going.

            <p>Ever find yourself making a sour face after talking to a coworker? Wishing your team meetings felt more like an engaging social hour? There is hope. Those everyday conflicts where something seems “off” after a conversation are often related to differences in communication styles. 
<br /><br />
When team members understand themselves and others, there’s less conflict, more collaboration, and better working relationships. The DiSC model can help you understand why your team behaves the way it does and how to build trust for a more agile team. 
<br /><br />
In this interactive session, agile coaches Allison Pollard and Barry Forrest will introduce the DiSC model to explain the four behavior types that are the ingredients in any team, then explore the characteristics of these ingredients and how they react with one another. Join them to learn about the behavior styles of you and your team using DiSC, how to communicate better together, and increase trust in the team. You'll leave with a common language that your team can use to better understand themselves and adapt their behaviors with others.

            <p>As agilists, how are we affected by our relationships with transforming organizations? Organizations treat an agile transformation as a singular event. A budgetary line item, a noun, a one-time metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly. The danger is that we expect people to transform in a particular way or on a schedule.
<br /><br />
We believe organizations benefit when we transform the way we assist organizations. In this interactive workshop, Allison and Barry will facilitate discussion on experiences with transformations and what might happen within an organization if we more actively transform ourselves.
<br /><br />
Join us as we explore who and what is transforming through agile transformations.
