              <p>Heidi coaches and influences fast-growing companies using practical, people-focused techniques. Her approach is based on experience at highly successful startups. The first was ExpertCity, Inc. (acquired by CitrixOnline) where she was on the development teams that invented GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar. Heidi helped the company scale from 15 employees to 800. Then she was Principal Agile Coach at AppFolio, Inc. makers of workflow software for property management and law verticals. There, she built a coaching group that supported dynamic, cross-functional teams as the company scaled from 10 people to 650. She is currently at Procore Technologies - a leading provider of cloud-based applications for construction. At Procore, Heidi is in R&D leadership, coaching and consulting on software development and reteaming best practices as this company scales globally.
<br/><br/>
Heidi challenges the notion that you need to keep your teams “the same” in order to be successful. Heidi’s book on Dynamic Reteaming has case studies from several well-known companies that change up their team compositions in order to meet market demands or to encourage continual learning or fulfillment of team members.

            <p>Reteaming is inevitable, especially when your company is hiring like crazy and doubling in size. Your teams grow and split. Twenty people arrive in one day. You acquire a company and need to blend. You have multiple offices and are distributed. With time, you can get better at morphing structurally and refocusing people and work. The question is, how can we best include and support the humans with all of this organizational change? I’ll share 5 recommendations.

Or is it the enablement provided by company leadership and coaches that makes the most significant impact?    Perhaps it is something else--maybe it all has to do with novelty.    In this talk, Ray Arell will share with you what he has learned from helping to launch more than three thousand Agile teams across hundreds of organizations.

            <p>Research has identified what Linda likes to call "an agile mindset," an attitude that equates failure and problems with opportunities for learning, a belief that we can all improve over time, that our abilities are not fixed but evolve with effort. What's surprising about this research is the impact of our mindset on creativity and innovation, estimation, and collaboration in and out of the workplace. Linda will share what we know so far about this mindset and offer some practical suggestions to help all of us become even more agile.
